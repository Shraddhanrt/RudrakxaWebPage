          Rudraksha has been mentioned in the majority of sacred Hindu
          scriptures. These dried fruit seeds hold such an important part in
          Hinduism that even the demons used to wear them along with the gods.
          As mentioned in Hindu mythology Ramayana, a multi-headed demon named
          Ravana used to wear a 27 mukhi rudraksha representing the 27 powers of
          Nakshatra (lunar mansion). With such an exciting history, let’s get to
          know more about this interesting valuable.

        <h4 style="font-size: 30px;"><i>What is Rudraksha?</i></h4>
        <p>
        Technically speaking, Rudraksha is the dried seed of Elaeocarpus
        ganitrus. Religiously, these stones are much more than that. They are
        worn by Hindu practitioners as a form of protection from bad spirits
        and also during the time of chanting mantras. Rudraksha is made of two
        words, Rudra & Raksha. Rudra, one of the other names of Lord Shiva,
        and akhsa meaning tears, all together Rudraksha means the tears of
        Rudra.

        <p>
          According to Vedas, Rudraksha was first created by Lord Shiva. As per the sacred text, Lord Shiva was in a
          deep state of meditation, with his eyes wide open, manifesting the ultimate weapon, Aghora. He remained in
          such a position for a thousand years and after he woke from that long penance, he couldn’t help but let a tear
          fall on the ground. The teardrop then turned into a tree to which Lord Shiva gave special powers.</p>
        <p>
   <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"> Lord Shiva </a>
          let the tree bear Rudraksha of 28 kinds, 16 representing the 16 different varieties of the moon and the rest
          representing the 12 different varieties of the Sun. According to the blessings of Lord Shiva, the one who
          holds a Rudraksha will attain Rudrahood, a state of being free from all sins.
        </p>

          Though Rudraksha can be found in countries like India, Bhutan, Burma, Indonesia, etc. it is mostly found in
          Nepal.
